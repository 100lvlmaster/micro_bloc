Micro bloc is a dead-simple flutter state management library made for quickly implementing the bloc pattern. It internally uses `rxdart` for streams. This package is great for small project. But for medium-large projects. I recommend using the official `bloc` and `flutter_bloc` libraries.

Things this library provides:
- Provides a BlocListener and BlocBuilder to listen and build on events.
- Bloc implementation in 200 lines of code.
